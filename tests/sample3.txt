## Abstract
This interdisciplinary research presents novel deep learning architectures for predicting patient outcomes using electronic health records (EHR) data. Our ensemble model combining LSTM networks, transformer architectures, and graph neural networks achieved 94.7% accuracy in predicting 30-day readmission rates across 50,000 patient records.

## 1. Introduction
Healthcare systems generate vast amounts of data daily, yet extracting actionable insights remains challenging. Traditional statistical methods often fail to capture complex patterns in multi-dimensional clinical data...

## 2. Methodology
### 2.1 Data Preprocessing
We utilized the MIMIC-IV dataset containing de-identified health records from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The preprocessing pipeline included:
- Data normalization using Z-score standardization
- Missing value imputation via K-nearest neighbors
- Feature engineering for temporal sequences
- HIPAA-compliant anonymization protocols

### 2.2 Model Architecture
Our hybrid architecture combines:
1. **LSTM Layer**: Captures temporal dependencies in patient vitals
2. **Transformer Encoder**: Processes clinical notes using BERT-Clinical
3. **Graph Neural Network**: Models relationships between diagnoses
4. **Attention Mechanism**: Identifies critical features for prediction

## 3. Results
The model demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline methods:
- Random Forest: 78.3% accuracy
- Support Vector Machine: 82.1% accuracy
- Standard LSTM: 87.4% accuracy
- **Our Hybrid Model: 94.7% accuracy**

## 4. Clinical Implications
This research enables healthcare providers to:
- Identify high-risk patients 48 hours before potential complications
- Optimize resource allocation in intensive care units
- Reduce healthcare costs through preventive interventions
- Improve patient outcomes through early intervention protocols

## 5. Conclusion
The integration of multiple deep learning paradigms shows promise for advancing precision medicine. Future work will focus on real-time deployment and multi-hospital validation studies.
